Who wrote the Federalist Papers?
The Federalist Papers were a series of essays written in 1787–1788 meant to persuade the citizens
of the State of New York to ratify the Constitution and which were published anonymously under
the pseudonym “Publius.” In later years the authors were revealed as Alexander Hamilton, John Jay,
and James Madison. However, there is some disagreement as to who wrote which essays. Hamilton
wrote a list of which essays he had authored only days before being killed in a duel with then
Vice President Aaron Burr. Madison wrote his own list many years later, which is in conflict with
Hamilton’s list on 12 of the essays. Since by this point the two (who were once close friends) had
become bitter rivals, historians have long been unsure as to the reliability of both lists.
This code is using Naive Bayes to classify who wrote the target 12 paragraph.
